# System Patterns: @yulolimum/toolkit

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a **prefix-based utility architecture** with independent scripts organized by domain category. Each script addresses specific automation needs while maintaining consistency in user experience and error handling across all domains (development, media, deployment, system administration, personal productivity).

## Key Technical Decisions

#### Package.json Script Mapping

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev:check-code-quality": "npx zx --install ./scripts/dev-check-code-quality.mjs",
    "dev:clean": "./scripts/dev-clean.sh",
    "dev:verify-software": "./scripts/dev-verify-software.sh",

    "system:cleanup-logs": "./scripts/system-cleanup-logs.sh",
    "personal:backup-configs": "./scripts/personal-backup-configs.sh"
  }
}
```

#### Language Choices by Domain

- **JavaScript (ESM)**: Interactive tools, development automation, complex user interfaces
- **Python**: Data processing, media management, analysis, machine learning tasks
- **Bash**: System operations, deployment, maintenance, file operations
- **Mixed Approach**: Choose optimal language for each specific automation need

### Design Patterns

#### Cross-Domain Consistency Patterns

**Unified User Experience**

- Consistent visual feedback (✅/❌) across all script categories
- Standardized parameter passing and configuration approaches
- Common error handling and reporting patterns regardless of implementation language
- Shared preference caching strategies where applicable

**Prefix-Based Organization**

```
Category Prefixes:
- dev-*     : Development workflow automation
- eas-*     : EAS (Expo Application Services) deployment automation
- media-*   : Media library and content management
- deploy-*  : General deployment and infrastructure automation
- system-*  : System administration and maintenance
- personal-*: Personal productivity and workflow optimization
```

#### Interactive CLI Pattern (JavaScript/Node.js)

**User Preference Caching**

```javascript
// Cache user selections to reduce decision fatigue across all interactive scripts
const cacheFile = path.join(__dirname, ".cache")
let cache = { [scriptCategory]: {} }

// Restore previous selections as defaults
checked: cache[scriptCategory].tools?.includes("tool") ?? true

// EAS-specific caching example
cache.easBuild = cache.easBuild ?? {}
default: cache.easBuild.platform ?? "all"
```

**Spinner-Based Feedback**

```javascript
// Provide visual feedback during long-running operations
const output = await spinner(`Running ${operation}...`, async function () {
  return await $({ nothrow: true })`command`
})
```

**Graceful Error Handling**

```javascript
// Continue execution even if individual operations fail
if (output.exitCode !== 0) {
  console.error(`❌ Error running ${operation}: ${output.stdout || output.stderr}`)
  process.exit(1)
} else {
  console.log(`✅ ${operation} completed successfully`)
}
```

#### Batch Processing Pattern (Python)

**File Collection and Processing**

```python
# Pattern for media and data processing scripts
def process_files(input_path, output_path, options):
    files = collect_files(input_path, file_patterns)
    for file in files:
        try:
            result = process_file(file, options)
            report_success(file, result)
        except Exception as e:
            report_error(file, e)
            continue  # Graceful degradation
```

**Progress Reporting**

```python
# Consistent progress reporting across batch operations
from tqdm import tqdm
for item in tqdm(items, desc="Processing"):
    process_item(item)
```

#### Safe Execution Pattern (Shell Scripts)

**Error Handling Strategy**

```bash
set -e # Exit on any error

# Safe execution with fallback for system operations
execute_safe_step() {
  echo "Executing: $1"
  eval $1 || true 2> /dev/null # Continue on failure for cleanup operations
}
```

**Resource Validation**

```bash
# Check system resources before operations
check_disk_space() {
  available=$(df -h . | awk 'NR==2 {print $4}')
  echo "Available disk space: $available"
}
```

**Version and Dependency Validation**

```bash
# Semantic version comparison for system tools
semver_lte() {
  printf '%s\n' "$1" "$2" | sort -C -V
}

# Flexible version checking with min/max constraints
validate_tool_version() {
  local tool=$1
  local min_version=$2
  local max_version=$3
  # Implementation for cross-script tool validation
}
```

## Component Relationships

### Multi-Domain Architecture Flow

```
package.json scripts → Category-specific utilities
                    ↓
Domain-specific Logic ← Shared Patterns ← Common Configuration
                    ↓
User Interface ← Tool/Process Execution ← Category Configuration
```

### Integration Points

- **Python**: JSON parsing with standard library
- **Shell**: jq for JSON parsing and manipulation
- **Shared Schema**: Common configuration structure across languages

**EAS Configuration Example**

```javascript
// EAS-specific configuration structure
cache.easBuild = {
  platform: 'all', // "ios", "android", "all"
  profile: 'preview', // "preview", "production"
  distribution: 'internal', // "store", "internal"
  runOnEAS: true, // true for EAS servers, false for local
}
```

## Error Handling Philosophy

### Universal Graceful Degradation

- Individual operation failures don't stop entire workflows across all domains
- Clear error messages with actionable information specific to each domain
- Distinction between warnings and critical failures across different script types
- Consistent error reporting format regardless of implementation language

### Cross-Domain User Feedback

- **Visual Indicators**: ✅ for success, ❌ for errors, ⚠️ for warnings (all domains)
- **Progress Indication**: Appropriate feedback for each domain (spinners, progress bars, status updates)
- **Detailed Output**: Domain-specific output with consistent formatting
- **Summary Reporting**: Aggregate results across batch operations

### Multi-Domain Recovery Strategies

- **Configuration Issues**: Fallback to defaults with clear guidance for customization
- **Missing Dependencies**: Domain-specific installation guidance (dev tools, media codecs, system utilities)
- **Resource Constraints**: Intelligent handling of disk space, memory, and processing limitations
- **Network Issues**: Retry logic and offline fallbacks for deployment and update operations
- **Permission Problems**: Clear guidance for file permissions and system access requirements

### Language-Specific Error Handling

- **JavaScript**: Promise-based error handling with detailed stack traces
- **Python**: Exception handling with context-aware error messages
- **Shell**: Exit code management with descriptive error output
- **Cross-Language**: Consistent error code conventions for script coordination
